WikiYear
========

This is a simple little node.js project that you pass a year to and it shows
a random event that happened in that year according to Wikipedia.

It uses the jquery library to make the request as well as traverse the DOM for
event information. Also, it's written in CoffeeScript.

It's a proof of concept for an easy to build yet pretty powerful web crawler
with very few lines of code.
